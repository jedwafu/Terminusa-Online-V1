# Comprehensive Plan for Web App Updates

## 1. Fix the Design and Layout for the Web App
- **Files to Update**:
  - `templates/base.html`: Improve the overall layout and structure.
  - `templates/index.html`: Enhance the homepage design.
  - `templates/announcements.html`: Update the layout for displaying announcements.
  - `static/css/main.css`: Modify styles for better aesthetics.
  - `static/css/marketplace.css`: Update styles for the marketplace section.

## 2. Fix the CRUD for Announcements
- **Files to Update**:
  - `web_app.py`: 
    - Ensure the `create_announcement` function checks if the user is an admin before allowing the creation of an announcement.
    - Confirm that the other CRUD operations are functioning correctly.

## 3. Only Admin Account Can Make Announcements
- **Files to Update**:
  - `web_app.py`: 
    - Implement authorization checks in the `create_announcement` function to restrict access to admin users only.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Test the changes to ensure the design updates are reflected correctly.
- Verify that only admin users can create announcements.
- Conduct a review of the CRUD functionality for announcements to ensure all operations work as expected.
