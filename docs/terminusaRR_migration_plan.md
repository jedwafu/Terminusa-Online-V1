# TerminusaRR Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to migrate `terminusaRR` from PHP/Chinese to Python/English while preserving game mechanics and improving security.

---

## 1. Translation and Code Migration

### 1.1 Translation Tasks
- Translate all Chinese comments, strings, and UI elements to English.
- Ensure all game text (e.g., item names, quest descriptions) is accurately translated.

### 1.2 Code Migration
- Convert PHP code to Python using SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- Replace PHP-specific functions with Python equivalents.
- Maintain game mechanics and features during the migration.

---

## 2. Database Migration

### 2.1 Schema Conversion
- Convert MySQL schema to SQLAlchemy models.
- Add new fields for multiple currencies (Solana, Exons, Crystals) and Web3 wallet integration.

### 2.2 Data Migration
- Export existing data from MySQL.
- Import data into the new SQLAlchemy-based database.
- Validate data integrity after migration.

## 3. Security Enhancements

### 3.1 Authentication
- Implement secure login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Add password hashing and salting for user accounts.

### 3.2 Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, wallet addresses) at rest and in transit.
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints.

### 3.3 Anti-Cheat Measures
- Add server-side validation for game actions.
- Monitor and log suspicious activities.

---

## 4. Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all migrated components.
- Test edge cases and error handling.

### 4.2 Integration Tests
- Test interactions between the migrated system and other components.
- Validate currency and wallet integration.

### 4.3 User Acceptance Testing
- Test the migrated system with real users.
- Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

---

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Environment Setup
- Set up Python environment with required dependencies.
- Configure database connections and environment variables.

### 5.2 Deployment Process
- Deploy the migrated system to the production server.
- Monitor system performance and stability.

---

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 Code Documentation
- Add docstrings and comments to all Python code.
- Generate API documentation using tools like Sphinx.

### 6.2 User Documentation
- Create a user guide for the migrated system.
- Include troubleshooting and FAQs.
