# Security Enhancements Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements to be implemented across `Terminusa Online`, `terminusaRR`, and `terminusaJet` to ensure secure and reliable gameplay.

---

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### 1.1 Secure Login
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
- Add password hashing and salting using bcrypt.

### 1.2 Role-Based Access Control
- Define roles (e.g., admin, user) and permissions.
- Restrict access to sensitive endpoints based on roles.

---

## 2. Data Protection

### 2.1 Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, wallet addresses) at rest using AES-256.
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints to encrypt data in transit.

### 2.2 Secure Logging
- Log security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts).
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information.

---

## 3. Anti-Cheat Measures

### 3.1 Server-Side Validation
- Validate all game actions on the server.
- Prevent client-side manipulation of game data.

### 3.2 Monitoring and Detection
- Monitor player behavior for unusual patterns.
- Implement automated detection of cheating attempts.

---

## 4. API Security

### 4.1 Rate Limiting
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs.
- Block IP addresses with excessive failed requests.

### 4.2 Input Validation
- Validate all API inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Sanitize user inputs to remove malicious content.

---

## 5. Testing and Validation

### 5.1 Security Audits
- Perform regular security audits of the codebase.
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.

### 5.2 Penetration Testing
- Conduct penetration testing to identify weaknesses.
- Fix vulnerabilities before deployment.

---

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 Security Policies
- Document security policies and procedures.
- Include incident response plans.

### 6.2 User Guidelines
- Create a guide for secure account management.
- Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts.

---

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this security plan.
2. Implement the security enhancements.
3. Test and validate the security measures.
4. Deploy to production and monitor for threats.
