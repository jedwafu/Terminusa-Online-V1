Hi Agent! Add this to your considerations of developing this game. This is an MMORPG play-to-earn dungeon hunter game integrated with Solana blockchain with game and marketplace currencies of Solana, Exons and Crystals. The game is text-based and must be playable on terminal via web browser technology called xterm.js. Here are the things to consider:


Instructions:
1.) Read and comprehend Terminusa Online files and documents.

2.) Re-align the source codes, database and design according to the notes provided below these instructions.

3.) We are already in the production stage of the game. Direct testing in production is our current practice.

4.) Create deploy.sh script. this will be our one-stop shop for deploying and managing the server.

5.) Improve the documentations and the README file for our git repo and create a changelog.md file to keep track on changes and progress on specific dates.

here are the notes to consider:

Project name: Terminusa Online
*this is inspired by solo leveling and known dungeon hunter games

-Make mechanics that the player should have an in-game wallet with 3 currencies (Solana, Exons and Crystals). Player can send exons from their web3 wallet or via swaps using a token swapper system in game and via web app when they connect their web3 wallets.
- **Solana**: Blockchain-based cryptocurrency for real-world value transactions.
- **Exons**: Solana blockchain-based governance token.
- **Crystals**: Off-chain in-game currency (soon to be tokenized as first utility token of the game).
-Monsters are called Magic Beasts
-Dungeons are called Gates
-Make AI Agent that learns from the players of the game like their choices in menus, activities performed in game (example, more on gambling than gate hunting or vice versa and a like), job class, profile, inventory, status, achievement and progression.

1.) I have a working VPS with IP 46.250.228.210 and domains:
a.) https://terminusa.online - serves as the main website and account management (view profile, view inventory, view achievements, view progress, view job class, view status, etc.). This share the same account information, maybe API calls could work?
b.) https://play.terminusa.online - servers as the play area of the game powered by xterm.js

2.) I have initial source codes prepared:
a.) study the existing files.
b.) prototype for xterm.js terminal game is this client.py - currently playable in linux and windows.

3.) Make a sustainable economy between these 3 currencies Solana, Exons, and Crystals. Create a token swapper system in game and via web app so players can swap solana for exons. Players can swap also exons for crystals.
a.) create marketplace system - viewable via website under https://marketplace.terminusa.online
b.) create trading system - can be done in game, trade inventory items for Exons and Crystals.

-----remote shop license can be bought by exons sells all antidotes for negative status like poisoned, feared, confused and etc (see health status system).
-----basic resurrection potions can be purchased via exons. resurrection potion revives a player from being dead and will give 50% HP healed.
-----higher resurrection poitions can be purchased via exons (this could resurrect a player from being dead, decapitated or a shadow) but the value is x3 of a basic resurrection potion and will give 100% HP healed.
d.) create gacha system for mounts and pets- can only be purchaed by Exons (Mount and pate grade system - Basic, Intermediate, Excellent, Legendary and Immortal). Must be AI agent powered depending on player activities performed in game (example, more on gambling than gate hunting or vice versa and a like), job class, profile, stats, level and must be probably fair.

All dropped loots and unrewarded loots will go to a admin account Solana wallet: FNEdD3PWMLwbNKxtaHy3W2NVfRJ7wqDNx4M9je8Xc6Mw
l.) create a tax system that is implemented to all transactions in game and in market place:
----13% tax of Crystals goes to the admin account username "adminbb"

Once a player has been resurrected using "Arise" he can no longer play the game and his character will be marked as shadow in health status and owned by the player who casted Arise during the battle system.

20.) We are deploying this in production using a Almalinux VPS 8.8 with apache(httpd)+nginx running as webserver and reverse proxy.
21.) We have to use TOML technology and not .env
22.) DB details are as follows>> username: root | password: Jeidel123
23.) We will retain the use of executable client file. Therefore, players may play using web browser https://play.terminusa.online and client executable file. Both will be connected to the same database and should only allow one session at a time, to prevent duplicate login and to prevent players from playing in both platforms at the same time.
